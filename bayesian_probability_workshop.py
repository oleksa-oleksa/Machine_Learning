Swedish Fish Incorporated is the largest Swedish company delivering fish by mail order.
They are now trying to get into the lucrative Danish market by selling one year Salmon subscriptions.
The marketing department have done a pilot study and tried the following marketing method:

A: Sending a mail with a colorful brochure that invites people to sign up for a one year salmon subscription.

The marketing department sent out 16 mails of type A.
Six Danes that received a mail signed up for one year of salmon
and marketing now wants to know, how good is method A?"""

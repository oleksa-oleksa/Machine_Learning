# Machine_Learning
My programming solutions for different ML Courses (FU Berlin, TU Berlin, Self-learning)

Contains code from a Python book that the author is currently reading, including an implementation of the state pattern in machine learning. 
The "Machine Learning" folder contains a variety of materials related to the field of machine learning, including Python code, 
Jupyter notebooks, and lecture notes from the TU Berlin, FU Berlin and self-learning path. 
The materials cover topics such as modern latest deep learning algorithms inl√∂luding RNNs, GANs and classic machine learning as decision trees, clustering, 
neural networks, and more, with a particular focus on implementation and visualization of these algorithms. 
Additionally, the folder contains specific implementations of algorithms such as Naive Bayes and k-NN classifiers, 
as well as examples of their use on real-world datasets like the yacht dataset. 
Overall, this collection provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in the practical application of machine learning algorithms using Python.
